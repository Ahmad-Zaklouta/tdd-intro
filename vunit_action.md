# Continuous Integration with VUnit Action (Part 1/2)

The other week, [semiengineering.com](https://semiengineering.com) published an [article](https://semiengineering.com/open-source-verification/) on open-source verification. It had one, rather obvious, conclusion.

> Verification is required to answer the question, 'Do you trust the piece of hardware you received?'
>
> -- <cite>Neil Hand, director of marketing for design verification technology at Mentor, a Siemens Business</cite>

Despite being obvious, IP providers often make it hard to gain that trust.

> When you buy IP, you usually get a very simple verification environment. This enables you to run a few demo tests or check configurations. You do not usually get the entire verification environment.
>
> -- <cite>Olivera Stojanovic, senior verification manager for Vtool</cite>

This is not unique to commercial IPs. Our [study](https://larsasplund.github.io/github-facts/index.html) of VHDL projects on GitHub shows that less than half of all projects provide tests at all, and the trend is declining (see Figure 1).

So, what are the reasons for not providing tests with the IPs?

> With complex IPs, they donâ€™t want to provide you with the verification environment, which is too complicated and potentially may provide insights that they might want to keep from you.

Keeping secrets is not a reason for not providing tests with public projects on GitHub, as everything is open/public. However, it can be complex to create a user-friendy online verification environment that clearly shows what has been tested and the status those tests. Thanks to [VUnit Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vunit-action) this is now much simpler, as it provides a continuous integration flow with just 8 lines of code.

If you're not familiar with VUnit, the following reading will set you up for the VUnit Action described in the next section.

# Continuous Integration with VUnit Action (Part 2/2)

The simple solution presented in Part 1 will get you started. Once you have that working there are a number of extra steps you can take to address the following issues:

* Improve the HTML visualization of the logs by using group/block decorators.
* Use a custom Docker image, to have additional dependencies pre-installed.
* Use a pytest script to handle multiple run.py scripts.
* Run the tests natively on the CI/CD environment (Ubuntu, Windows and/or macOS), instead of using a Docker container.

In this second post on continuous integration with VUnit, we will focus on other alternatives that allow more detailed customization.
